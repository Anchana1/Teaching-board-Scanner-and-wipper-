TEACHING BOARD SCANNER AND WIPER!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In teaching field - board , duster, chalk makes crucial element .
To erase the writing from large size board consume lots of  time and to copy them. 
It may breaks the concentration between both lectures and listeners.
This paper represents the design and construction of automatic board wiper and scanner.
It consists of dc  motor , wiper blade , wiper arms , portable scanner
The automatic teaching board wiper reduce the time and effort required
The Automatic board wiper is a spectacular replacement of “duster”.
Our main aim of our project is to save time and energy . 
Around 80 – 70% of educational institution use teaching board .
In an technology world it is impossible to spend time on cleaning of board and to copy them.
Instead of this we can use board scanner and wiper .
------------------------------WORKING----------------------
When power is provided -AC is converts into DC by eliminator, then  the small electric motor rotates (back to forth).
Wiper generally consist of a metal arm ,one end pivots the other end has line cotton blade attached to it .
When the  arms move the actual wiper handle where it could with scanner and wiper ,the scanner scans the entire board and share to students where the another side with wiper to clears the board
Board wipers are operated by an electric motor  (back to forth) . 
The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion.
The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move
Portable Scanner scans images or pictures quickly: Store JPEG/PDF files within seconds, scan images or pictures quickly, plug and play, no need any software preinstalled.
The arms move the actual wiper blades. The blades are made of cotton cloths and must apply enough pressure to the board in order to remove the dust.
The arms attach to the middle of each wiper blade, and each wiper blade has several arms that distribute the pressure onto the board evenly.
